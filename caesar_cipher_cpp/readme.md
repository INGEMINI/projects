# Caesar Cipher in C++

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm** in **C++**. This project demonstrates how to shift characters in a string by a specified number of positions, enabling basic text encryption and decryption.



## Introduction

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This project provides an interactive C++ program that allows users to:
1. Encrypt plaintext.
2. Decrypt ciphertext.




### Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang).
- A terminal or IDE that supports C++ compilation (e.g., VS Code, CLion, Code::Blocks).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-cpp.git
